# Data Structures and algorithms in JS :mortar_board: :mag_right: :sparkles:

> Bad programmers worry about the code. Good programmers worry about data structures and their relationships.
— Linus Torvalds, Creator of Linux and Git

## Data Structures

There are 3 Data Structures at high-level:

#### Array-like structures

* Stacks
* Queues


#### Structures with nodes

* Linked Lists
* Trees
* Graphs

#### Structure depends on hash functions

* Hash Tables

### Stack

> Last In, First Out!
— Stack

In JS we use it everywhere!




## Algorithms
